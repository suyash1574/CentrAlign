### CentrAlign AI Agent – Chrome Extension (Assignment Submission)

## Overview

This project implements a fully local AI Reasoning Agent inside a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) as required in the assignment. The extension performs:

- Rule-based planning
- Local semantic search (toy embeddings + cosine similarity)
- Local keyword search (normalized scores)
- Hybrid matching
- Confidence-based fallback (Pinecone stub)
- Structured JSON output
- Modern, clean popup UI

Everything runs entirely offline, with no external API calls.
